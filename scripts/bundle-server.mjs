// Bundle each harness-server entry point into a self-contained ESM file.
//
// Why this exists: the packaged app ships ZERO node_modules (see the files:
// exclusion in electron-builder.yml), so anything the server imports by bare
// specifier has to be inlined — `tsc` only transpiles, it leaves
// `import { z } from "zod"` verbatim and the packaged server dies at startup
// with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. That shipped once, in 0.1.24.
//
// Bundling every entry point rather than only index.ts is deliberate: the
// proxies are spawned as their own processes and today import nothing from
// node_modules, but nothing stops the next one from doing so, and the failure
// is invisible until a packaged build is actually launched.
//
// Entry points must keep their exact relative paths under dist-server — the
// server locates each proxy by path (server/index.ts:108,
// container-computer.ts:773, drivers/acp/core.ts:43), preferring the .ts in
// dev and falling back to the sibling .js in the packaged tree. outbase keeps
// drivers/ nested; import.meta.url still resolves to the same location, so
// that lookup is unaffected.
