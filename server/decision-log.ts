// The authorization DECISION log: one fleet-wide, append-only NDJSON file
// answering "which tool call was allowed, denied, or carded — by which
// rule, when, for which bot".
//
// The per-thread event log (harness/bus.ts) cannot answer that. It records
// that a request opened and later resolved, but the WHY — a grant waved it
// through, a guard held it, an unattended block overrode a grant that
// would otherwise have fired — exists only for a moment at the fold point
// and is gone by the time the event is on disk. So the fold writes the
// reason down here at the moment it is known, and the human-answer path
// writes a second row when a card comes back.
//
// Same discipline as the event tee: 0600 (rows name tools and command
// lines), through redactSecrets (summaries carry whatever the agent typed,
// credentials included), and fire-and-forget — an audit log must never
// take down the decision it is auditing.
//
// Deliberately NOT covered: ask_bot peer-approval cards. They never cross
// the runtime bus (peer-approval.ts appends its cards straight to the
// store), so wiring them here would mean a second, parallel tap — a
// separate change if it earns its keep.
