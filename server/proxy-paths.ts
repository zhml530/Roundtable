// That is not hypothetical: it shipped into the 0.1.24 release candidate.

// also sit at the server root (index, computer-proxy) — the
// nested drivers/* entries import nothing local, which is what keeps the
// anchor correct in both the dev tree and the bundle. proxy-paths.test.ts pins
// that invariant. Resolve proxies through SPAWNED_PROXIES and nowhere else.
