 * an approval or question card (request.opened → request.resolved) —
 * waiting on a person is not work, and stopping the turn under an open
 * card manufactures the stranded-approval state the harness otherwise has
 * to repair after the fact. Streaming, tool runs, and provider latency
 * still burn the budget normally; a turn that goes silent entirely is
 * separately caught by the stall watchdog.
 *
 * Requests pair opened→resolved per thread, but resolves can also arrive
 * for cards this turn never opened (stale cleanup after an interrupt), so
 * the count clamps at zero instead of trusting perfect pairing.
