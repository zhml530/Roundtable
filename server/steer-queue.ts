// Queue-and-steer for busy 1:1 bots.
//
// A message sent to a bot mid-turn used to bounce with a 409. Now it waits
// here until the bot settles, then lands in the thread and runs as ONE
// follow-up turn whose prompt is the queued texts joined with newlines.
//
// The queue is memory-only and is NOT in `messages[]` while the current
// turn is running: appending immediately would make the queued line the
// active leaf, so remaining tool/assistant events of *this* turn would
// hang off a user line the model has not seen. Restart loses the queue
// (same as delegations / approvals). The composer shows a pending chip
// until drain appends the words.
//
// Unlike the delegation drain, an interrupted or failed turn does NOT
// discard this queue: delegations are a bot's fan-out (dropping them on
// Stop is a safety property), but these are the user's own words —
// stop-then-steer (queue a correction, hit Stop, the correction runs) is
// the feature.
